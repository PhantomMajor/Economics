The three exisisting economic systems are -


## Capitalism ##
The economic system based on private ownership of capital goods and means of production, and the production of goods for profit. It's elsements include:

1. Capital Accumulation
2. Competitive Market
3. Price System

*Merits*
1. In accordance with *Adam Smith's* "_Law of Invisible Hand_".
    Each individual protects his own interests.
2. Profit margin becomes the driving force, hence efficiency of people tends to be high.

*Demerits*
1. The society gets divided into "rich" and "poor".
    The unequal distribution of wealth leads to differentiation of class.
2. Without government intervention, adoption of unfair means (to earn more profits) might lead to exorbitant prise rise. 
3. The market tends to monopolise.
4. It leads to different forms of economic and cultural exploitation.


## Socialism ##
An economic system characterised by *_social ownership_* of the means of production and cooperative management of the economy.

Social Ownership -- cooperative Enterprise, common ownership, state ownership or citizen ownership of _equity_.

*Merits*
1. Leads to "uniform" or "equal" distribution of money, wealth and resources. It thus eliminates the class division and problems related to it (exploitation and social alienation).
2. Prices are mere reflection of supply and demand forces (as profits are not the motive)
3. Tries to control the cycle in which the rich become richer and the poor become poorer.

*Demerits*
1. Lack of 'incentives'. The efficiancy of the state firms is considerably less than capitalist firms. This results in reduced economic welfare of the country.
2. Lack of 'competition' discourages firms form RnD.
